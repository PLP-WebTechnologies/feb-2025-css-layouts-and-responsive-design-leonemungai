      <div class="grid-item">1 The first step to really unplugging from our preconditioning (i.e. the feminine Matrix) is recognizing 
        that this conditioning has led to the beliefs we think are integral to our personalities. The 
        psychological term for this is called ‘ego-investment’. When a person internalizes a mental schema so 
        thoroughly, and has become conditioned to it for so long, it becomes an integral part of their 
        personality. So to attack the belief is to, literally, attack the person. This is why we see such a violent 
        reaction to people’s political, religious, inter-social/inter-sexual, inter-gender, etc. expressions of 
        belief – they perceive it as a personal attack, even when presented with irrefutable, empirical 
        evidence that challenges the veracity of those beliefs.</div>
      <div class="grid-item">2. People resort to denial when recognizing that the truth would destroy something they hold dear. In the 
        case of a cheating partner, denial lets you avoid acknowledging evidence of your own humiliation. 
        Short of catching a spouse in bed with your best friend, evidence of infidelity is usually ambiguous. 
        It’s motivated skepticism. You’re more skeptical of things you don’t want to believe and demand a 
        higher level of proof. Denial is unconscious, or it wouldn’t work: if you know you’re closing your 
        eyes to the truth, some part of you knows what the truth is and denial can’t perform its protective 
        function.</div>
      <div class="grid-item">3. One thing we all struggle to protect is a positive self-image. The more important the aspect of your 
        self-image that’s challenged by the truth, the more likely you are to go into denial. If you have a strong 
        sense of self-worth and competence, your self-image can take hits but remain largely intact; if you’re 
        beset by self-doubt (a hallmark of self-righteous AFC thinking), however, any acknowledgment of 
        failure can be devastating and any admission of error painful to the point of being unthinkable. Self- 
        justification and denial arise from the dissonance between believing you’re competent, and making a 
        mistake, which clashes with that image.</div>
      <div class="grid-item">4. Real Power is the degree to which a person has control over their own circumstances. Real Power is 
        the degree to which we actually control the directions of our lives. 
        When we allow our thinking, our personality disorders and our mental schemas, combined with their 
        accompanying behaviors, to determine the course of our decisions, we relinquish real Power. The 
        man who succumbs, by force or by will, to the responsibilities, liabilities and accountabilities that 
        are required of him by society, marriage, commitment, family, fatherhood, career choice, the military, 
        etc. leaves him very little influence over the course of his own life.</div>
